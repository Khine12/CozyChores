# 🧹 CozyChores

CozyChores is a shared household chore app designed to help roommates, couples, or families organize and manage household tasks together. Users can create or join a group, assign chores, and track what’s due — all in a clean, cozy interface.

> ⚠️ This is the **frontend-only version**, built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and uses `localStorage` to save data on the current device.  
> 🔄 I’m currently upgrading it to a **full-stack Firebase version** to enable real-time syncing across multiple users and devices.
